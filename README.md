## A NES game brought into the third dimension. Desolite Tanks

#### - The game is surrounded by the concept of you only having 1 airborne bullet at a time which makes you more deadly in close ranges but you only have 1 health point which makes it easy to take you out.

#### - The goal of the game as of the current state is to survive an onslaught of never ending enemies that are tying to destroy your base. Your base, just like you, can only take 1 hit and thats game.

#### - Power ups are dropped from above every now and then. They may assist you or your opponents as any team can take the power ups.
