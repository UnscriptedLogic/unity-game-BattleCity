## A NES game brought into the third dimension. Desolite Tanks

#### - The game is surrounded by the concept of you only having 1 airborne bullet at a time which makes you more deadly in close ranges but you only have 1 health point which makes it easy to take you out.

#### - The goal of the game as of the current state is to survive an onslaught of never ending enemies that are tying to destroy your base. Your base, just like you, can only take 1 hit and thats game.

#### - Power ups are dropped from above every now and then. They may assist you or your opponents as any team can take the power ups.

## Main Story
A special material, dubbed as 'Desolite' and discovered when a strange crystal meteor struck a zoo on earth, was infused into a bullet as an experiment to tap into the material's special characteristics of bending time and space. According to scientists, when struck together, the Desolite crystals seemed to remember its state at the time of being struck and its orientation and position in space. Breaking apart the shard at this time results in a leak of its energy, using it to put itself back together in the position, orientation and state when the first strike happened like memory foam returning to its state after the tension was released.

Using this new found knowledge, scientists began infusing bullets with desolite and found that the need for bullet magazines were no more since the bullets need only have to hit its target before re-constructing in its barrel where the gun hammer, tipped with desolite, first struck. They began more and more tests feeling as though they had discovered a brand new element.

The quote "Curiousity killed the cat" could not have been more truer the day the scientist began infusing Tanks with Desolite, dubbing their new found arsenal of tanks as the Desolite Tanks. A driver was needed to pilot the tanks but no one was brave enough to face a crash head on that could potentially end their life so they began tests with the animals that were rescued from the zoo that the meteor first crash landed in. However, no matter how many times the test was repeated, the tank reconstructed, but the animals didn't. 

It did not take long for the scientists to realize that they had already solved this problem but didn't look into it this far. "Breaking apart the shard at this time results in a leak of its energy, using it to put itself back together in the position, orientation and state when the first struck happened". Life was a form of energy as well and the shard had mixed the energy of the crystal and the energy of the animal together, creating mindless driverless tanks. Some tanks seemed to have retained their animal instinct to hunt while some retained some of their traits.

The player was the first successful human being to survive the trip back from the reconstruction. Using special paddings in the vehicles, the player was able to follow the tank back from the reconstruction but padded enough to seperate his energy and is now tasked with clearing out the swarm and putting an end to this misery.
